I am an extremely efficient software engineering consultant and entrepreneur from Tampa, FL. 

I am always seeking opportunities to collaborate with entrepreneurs to enact massive changes with technology.

History:
* Sharpspring.com - Sr. Engineer - $15m exit.
* Roobet.com - Backend Architect/Developer - 8 figure yearly revenue.
* Arcanium.io - Founded 2019 - 7 figure yearly revenue.
* Countless product launches and consultations

Methodology:

Clients ask how I can build solutions with such efficiency. I use pareto's principle and the art of simplicity to build the most efficient technical solutions. I have proven that a single well-enabled engineer can build and manage an entire web platform using modern tools. I have focused my entire career on the process of zero to one - getting things off the ground. Getting paying customers and validating a product. 

I have a large network of engineers who can take over for long term development, or I can help you build a team.
